The coke oven is the core piece of equipment for coking.
The coal-charging and coke-pushing car is one of the most critical pieces of equipment in coke-oven operations.
Wet quenching is a traditional method in which red-hot coke is cooled by spraying it with water.
Dry quenching cools coke with an inert gas, allowing heat to be recovered.
The coke screening building classifies coke by size into large, medium, and small coke.
The coal blending process is an important step in ensuring coke quality.
A heat-recovery coke oven uses waste heat from coking to generate electricity.
After purification, coke oven gas can be used as a fuel or as a chemical feedstock.
The dust removal system ensures emissions meet environmental standards.
The production scheduling center coordinates the operation of each process.
The quality inspection center is responsible for quality testing of coke products.
The electrical system provides reliable power to all plant equipment.
The instrumentation and automatic control system enables automated management of the production process.
A safety management system is the fundamental safeguard for safe production.
Performance evaluation verifies whether the plant's design targets are met.
