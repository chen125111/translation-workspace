Coke ovens are the core equipment for coking.
The coal charging and coke pushing car is one of the most critical pieces of equipment in coke oven operations.
Wet quenching is a traditional method in which red-hot coke is cooled by water spraying.
Dry quenching (CDQ) cools coke with an inert gas, enabling heat recovery.
The coke screening building classifies coke by size into large, medium, and small coke.
Coal blending is a key step in ensuring coke quality.
A heat recovery coke oven uses the waste heat from coking for power generation.
After purification, coke oven gas (COG) can be used as a fuel or as a chemical feedstock.
The dust collection system ensures emissions meet environmental compliance standards.
The production scheduling center coordinates the operation of each process.
The quality inspection center is responsible for quality testing of coke products.
The electrical system provides reliable power for all plant equipment.
The instrumentation and control system enables automated management of the production process.
The safety management system is the fundamental safeguard for safe production.
Performance assessment verifies whether the plant's design specifications are met.
